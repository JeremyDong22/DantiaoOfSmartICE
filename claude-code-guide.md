## üéä You're In! Now What?

### Understanding Your Plan Limits
- **Max Plan**: You're on the premium tier (fancy!)
- **Token Usage**: Each interaction uses tokens (think of them as AI energy points)

- **Monitor Usage**: Check your usage in the app settings

### First Steps to Take
1. **Say Hello**: Start with "Hello, Claude!" (politeness matters)
2. **Ask a Simple Question**: "What can you help me with?"
3. **Test File Access** (Desktop/CLI): "Can you read files on my computer?"
4. **Explore MCP Tools** (Desktop): Try "Can you open a browser tab?"

## üÜò Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### Common Issues and Fixes

**"I can't log in!"**
